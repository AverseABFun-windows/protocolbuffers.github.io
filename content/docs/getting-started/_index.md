Each tutorial in this section shows you how to implement a simple application
using protocol buffers in your favourite language, introducing you to the
language's protocol buffer API as well as showing you the basics of creating and
using .proto files. The complete sample code for each application is also
provided.

The tutorials don't assume that you know anything about protocol buffers, but do
assume that you are comfortable writing code in your chosen language, including
using file I/O.
